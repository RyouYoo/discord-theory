Part1: My attempt to reverse the Discord nitro token generation function.

The Nitro generation tools thing is common in Discord now, but none of the tools actually works, so I decided to take it to the next level, and reverse the actual tokens in hopes of finding a better way of generation.

## Introducation:
If you are not familiar with Discord, nitro is a kind of membership, you pay to get access and do some cool things on Discord, like get a GIF profile picture or upload large size photos and videos, and in order to get it you must either buy it directly or having someone offer it to you, in the second case it would be something like this:
```

```
The Discord Gift URL followed by a 16-length code will redirect you to the claim page.
